    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a 22 year old who currently lives in Leeds, and works at SkyBet keen to make a career change</p>
    <p>I first started going to an after school coding club which peaked my interest in technology. 
        However, I never had the opportunity to persue this full-time. 
        When I got a bit older I then started taking free online courses like codecademy learning languages like HTML and CSS.</p>
